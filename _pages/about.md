Hi! I am Henry Sanford. 

My first internship was at UW Genome Sciences where I worked on a [tool for mass-spectrometer data analysis](https://skyline.ms/project/home/begin.view?). Next summer I headed to New York to work in the data science department at [Regeneron](https://www.regeneron.com/). I currently work in UW Biology and am looking for new roles.
