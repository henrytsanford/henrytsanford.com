Hi! I am a student at the University of Washington studying Biology and Data Science. 

I spent last summer at UW Genome Sciences where I worked on a [tool for mass-spectrometer data analysis](https://skyline.ms/project/home/begin.view?). Next summer I am headed to New York to work in the data science department at [Regeneron](https://www.regeneron.com/)!

In my free time, I enjoy going to concerts and binging sci-fi novels.
