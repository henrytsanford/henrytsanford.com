Hi! I am a student at the University of Washington. 

I spent last summer at UW Genome Sciences where I worked on a tool for mass-spectrometer data analysis. Next summer I'm headed to New York to work in the data science department at Regeneron!

In my free time, I enjoy going to concerts and exploring the trails around Seattle.
