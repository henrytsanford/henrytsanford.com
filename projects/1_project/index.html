    <p class="post-description">What are the longest common phrases in classic books?</p>
  </header>

  <article>
    <p>I implemented a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffix array</a> and then used it to identify the longest common phrase between pairs of texts. I sourced the text files from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Guttenberg Project</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the results, sorted by length:</p>
